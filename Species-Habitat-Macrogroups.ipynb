    "# GAP Species Habitat Associations and the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) System Hierarchy\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose <a name=\"purpose\"></a>\n",
    "The U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Project (GAP) created habitat maps for 1590 terrestrial vertebrate species throughout the conterminous US (CONUS), including 219 sub-species. Each species was associated with one or more land cover types represented in the National GAP Land Cover Map (McKerrow et al. 2018, Gergely et al. 2019). The USGS GAP Land Cover Map used vegetation classes based on NatureServe’s Ecological Systems Classification (Comer et al. 2003) and land cover classes described in the National Land Cover Dataset (Homer et al. 2007). These data described vegetation communities at a level of thematic detail useful for ascribing habitat types for species. A crosswalk of that map legend with the nested hierarchy of the US National Vegetation Classification (NVC) permits the assessment of species habitat extents throughtout a broadening thematic vegetation classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook specifically outlines using the crosswalk of species habitat associations in the GAP land cover map with NVC macrogroups for linking USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot level forest composition and structure data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs <a name=\"inputs\"></a>\n",
    "The code in this notebook is a first step in combining GAP species habitat association information with FIA plot level data wherein forest structure and composition are tied to NVC macrogroup classes. Since the GAP habitat maps were developed using deductive methods (McKerrow et al. 2018, Gergely et al. 2019) which include landscape attributes other than land cover, it was necessary to identify species whose associations include forest and no other ancillary data such as distance to water or elevation limits.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Data compiled by code in this notebook are assembled in a wildlife habitat relationship database (WHRdb). The WHRdb was queried to compile a list of species associated with at least one forested land cover type (referred to as <b>map units</b> in WHRdb tables) and no ancillary landscape attributes. Modeling parameters were assembled for each species by seasonality - summer (breeding for migratory birds), winter, and year-round (habitat utilized during both summer and winter). Additionally, modeling regions were used to stratify the CONUS into six regions (Northwest, Southwest, Great Plains, Upper Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast). These regions allowed for efficient processing of the species distribution models on smaller, ecologically homogenous extents. Therefore, species habitat associations may occur in multiple seasons and/or across multiple regions. A species model code was developed to maintain unique season/region combinations.\n",

    "## Constraints <a name=\"constraints\"></a>\n",
    "The Land Cover data attempts to map as accurately as possible the fine vegetative details of the nation’s vegetation. However, there are some limitations to the data that users should keep in mind. The data set uses a 30 meter pixel cell and in most areas a minimum mapping unit of 0.4 ha (1 acre). This means that small patches of vegetation can be missed in the modeling process.  The USNVC is a dynamic content standard, reflecting the state of the science at any point in time; therefore this analysis represents the conservation assessment based on the types that were named and described in the 2017 release of the classification.  \n",
