    "## Purpose <a name=\"purpose\"></a>\n",
    "The USGS Gap Anaysis Program (GAP) and the USDA LANDFIRE working groups have developed land use/land cover datasets for the conterminous United States under the auspices of the vegetation sub-committe of the Federal Geographic Data Committe and the Ecolgoical Society of America's release of the US National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) version 2.01. The USNVC (or NVC) is an 8-level hierarchical classification of the native and non-native vegetation of the nation down to the species association level.\n",
    "\n",
    "GAP has also produced a composite map of the protected areas witin the United States categorized at four levels of protection status (1-4). The Protected Areas Database (PAD) also contains data on management including manager name (eg. USDA Forest Service, county park, easement) and type (eg. federal, state, local, private).\n",
    "\n",
    "Intersecting these two datasets facilitates assessment of the areal and spatial extent of protection across various vegetation classes and management throughout the country. This biological analysis package illustrates a readily available, repeatable, transparent and rapid process to conduct just such an assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs <a name=\"inputs\"></a>\n",
    "The code in this notebook is intended to provide a summarization for NVCS classes for GAP Protected Areas Database (PAD) status levels 1, 2, and 3 across PAD mangement categories.\n",
    "    \n",
    "It utilizes an SQL server database assembled by intersecting numerous raster data layers created by the Gap Analysis Program including the PAD-US, species habitat maps, boundary layers such as states, counties, LCCs, ecoregions, etc. That database (the GAP Analytic database) at the time of this workflow development was only available on a local server. Hence, all code references a local instance of this database. This code is only replicable given access to a local instance of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ### SQL Database <a name=\"subinput1\"></a>\n",
    "This analysis utilizes the GAP Analytic database developed by Linda Scheuk, Anne Davidson, and Leah Dunn at Boise State University. Information about access to a given instance of this database is pending.\n",
