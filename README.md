# NVC Analyses
Repo for analyses using data on the National Vegetation Classification system

Python code included in this repository is used to analyze protection status for various National Vegetation Classification System (NVC) land cover categories. Additionally, there are analyses relating GAP species habitat associations and NVC classification hierarchy. In order to generate both analyses, it was necessary to utilize the GAP analytic database (a Microsoft SQL server database created by Linda Schueck at USGS in Boise, ID) and a wildlife habitat relationship database (WHRdb). Copies of both the GAP analytic and WHRdb databases reside on servers at the BaSIC lab at NC State University. The analyses would not be possible without connecting to one or both of these databases unless at some time in the future the data are transferred to an online, open source system. If and when that occurs, the code in this repository will need to be re-written.
